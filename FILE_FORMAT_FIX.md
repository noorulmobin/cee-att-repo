# 📁 **File Format Issue Fixed - Complete**

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The "Unrecognized image file format" error was occurring because:
- ❌ **Wrong File Extension**: Downloaded files had original image extensions (jpg, png) but contained text content
- ❌ **File Type Mismatch**: Image files were being saved as text files with image extensions
- ❌ **Opening Error**: When users tried to open downloaded files, they got format errors

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

I've completely fixed the file format issues by implementing proper file type detection and appropriate file extensions.

### **New Download System:**
